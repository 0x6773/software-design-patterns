# Composite

Wikipedia : [Composite Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern)

The composite pattern describes that a group of objects is to be treated in the same way as a single instance of an object. The intent of a composite is to "compose" objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Implementing the composite pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
