Wikipedia : [Flyweight Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyweight_pattern)

A flyweight is an object that minimizes memory use by sharing as much data as possible with other similar objects; it is a way to use objects in large numbers when a simple repeated representation would use an unacceptable amount of memory.
